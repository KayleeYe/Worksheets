# ### Linear Algebra Review
# 
# If you need a linear algebra review, please read through the [following pdf](https://github.com/gallettilance/CS506-Spring2023/raw/main/worksheets/lecture_03_linear_algebra_review.pdf) before next class
# 
# ### Intro to Data Science
# 
# a) what property must a hypothesis have?

# The hypothesis should have conditions and predicted results which should also include expected results and unexpected results.

# b) what examples would you have wanted to try?

# (2,3,4)

# c) Poll 1

# C (1,2,3)

# d) Given the hypothesis (x, 2x, 3x), for each of the following, determine whether they are positive or negative examples:
# 
# - (2, 4, 6)
# - (6, 8 , 10)
# - (1, 3, 5)

# Positive: (2,4,6)
# Negative: (6,8,10)
#           (1,3,5)

# e) Poll 2

# (1,2,3)

# f) Describe steps of a Data Science Workflow

# <br>1. First ask what the model is used for?
# <br>2. process data: make all assumptions about the data, find the goal
# <br>3. explore data: plan on data
# <br>4. extract features
# <br>5. create model

# g) Give a real world example for each of the following data types:
# 
# - record
# - graph
# - image
# - text

# <br>record: BU students names and student ids
# <br>graph: slides shown in class
# <br>image: pictures posted in instagram
# <br>text: email

# h) Give a real world example of unsupervised learning

# anomaly detection

# 

# i) Give a real world example of supervised learning

# House price predicting
